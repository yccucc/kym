        <p class="justify Quicksand">Chrome is changing its logo for the first time since 2014, and if you squint really hard, you might actually be able to see what’s different.
          Elvin Hu, a designer for Google Chrome, offers a first look at the logo’s redesign in a thread on Twitter, as well as some of the thinking behind the ever-so-subtle changes.
          <br><br>Instead of incorporating shadows on the borders between each color, essentially “raising” them off the screen, the red, yellow, and green are simply flat.
          And while not mentioned by Hu, the blue circle in the middle seems to be bigger and stares into your soul even more, but maybe that’s just my imagination.

          and the state of Michigan
          have agreed to provide infrastructure and other support for the Michigan Central Innovation District that will include the defunct train depot and other nearby buildings in the historic Corktown neighbourhood just outside downtown,
          officials said.<br><br>“Together, this is another sign that we are moving forward in a way that shows Michigan is in it to win, that we are going to lead in the mobility sector, that we are serious about developing high-tech and
          high-skilled jobs,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said during an event inside the old train station.<br><br>Ford announced plans for the Michigan Central Innovation District in 2018, shortly after it bought the 18-story,
          500,000-square-foot (46,450-square-metre) train depot. Renovations at the more than century-old Michigan Central Station could be completed by next year, Ford Motor Fund President Mary Culler told The Associated Press. Ford plans to
          research, test and launch new mobility solutions there.</p>

          with what the Senate passed about eight months ago. President Joe Biden urged lawmakers to reach a deal quickly, saying, “America can't afford to wait.”<br><br>The nearly 3,000-page bill, not counting scores of amendments added this week,

          (roughly Rs. 3,35,900 crore) to strengthen supply chains for high-tech products.</p>
